## Key Takeaways From this Exercise

Through this exercise, I leared how to properly set up a Github repository and deploy a website from this repo using Github Pages 
specifically through a User Page. I was also able to apply and strengthen my knowledge in creating and designing websites using HTML and CSS only. This also helped me better understand the process of publishing a live website through GitHub Pages.
